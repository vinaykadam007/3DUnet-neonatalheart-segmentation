## üìå Overview
This project focuses on **3D U-Net‚Äìbased segmentation** of **cardiac light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) images** of neonatal mouse hearts. The pipeline was designed to handle **large volumetric datasets (1000+ slices per stack)**, enabling precise segmentation of multiple cardiac structures for downstream morphometric and functional analysis.

**Objective:** Develop and fine-tune a 3D U-Net deep learning model for robust and accurate segmentation of neonatal mouse cardiac structures from large-scale LSFM datasets.  
**Outcome:** Achieved **0.84 IoU** on validation and test datasets by leveraging preprocessing and **data augmentation** strategies (elastic transforms, flips, grid distortions) to enhance robustness and generalization„Äê50‚Ä†source„Äë.

## üß™ Methodology

- **Data:** Light-sheet microscopy datasets of neonatal mouse hearts (stacks of 1000+ images).  
- **Preprocessing:**  
  - Resized images to **512√ó512** pixels.  
  - Applied grayscale normalization.  
  - Augmentation pipeline (horizontal/vertical flips, elastic transforms, grid distortion).  
- **Architecture:** 3D U-Net with encoder‚Äìdecoder design, convolution layers, pooling, and transpose convolutions for upsampling„Äê50‚Ä†source„Äë.
- **Training:**  
  - Loss: Dice + Cross-Entropy.  
  - Optimizer: Adam.  
  - Early stopping to prevent overfitting.  
- **Evaluation Metric:** Intersection over Union (IoU).

## üìä Results

### Without Augmentation
- Validation IoU: **0.49** (poor generalization).  

### With Augmentation
- Validation IoU: **0.84**.  
- Test IoU: ranged from **0.84 to 0.91** across different images„Äê50‚Ä†source„Äë.
